    <p>I am an engineer who wants to become an application developer. I know a little about computer networks
      (once I even set up ipsec on Cisco), I know how to program quite a bit,
      I want to make friends with linux, but most of all I want to become a developer
      and create cool applications. Well, or sites. Well, or work in a team on some big cool projects.
      P.S. And I also have 2 guys - my beloved husband and son.</p>
